    abstractNote = {In 1980 the multilevel multichannel R-matrix code SAMMY was released for use in analysis of neutron-induced cross section data at the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator. Since that time, SAMMY has evolved to the point where it is now in use around the world for analysis of many different types of data. SAMMY is not limited to incident neutrons but can also be used for incident protons, alpha particles, or other charged particles; likewise, Coulomb exit hannels can be included. Corrections for a wide variety of experimental conditions are available in the code: Doppler and resolution broadening, multiple-scattering corrections for capture or reaction yields, normalizations and backgrounds, to name but a few. The fitting procedure is Bayes' method, and data and parameter covariance matrices are properly treated within the code. Pre- and post-processing capabilities are also available, including (but not limited to) connections with the Evaluated Nuclear Data Files. Though originally designed for use in the resolved resonance region, SAMMY also includes a treatment for data analysis in the unresolved resonance region.},

    abstractNote = {The state of the JEF-2 evaluation of { 238}U + n cross sections in the region of unresolved resonances ({approximately} 10 to 300 keV) is reported with special emphasis on recent progress in theory (rigorous expressions for resonance-averaged cross sections with arbitrary level overlap), which permits reliable model-aided evaluation and parameterization by simultaneous fits to total, capture, and inelastic scattering cross-section data. Formalized inclusion of information from resolved resonances via Bayes' theorem has helped to remove discrepancies between resolved and unresolved parameters and has improved resonance statistics. Comparison with the latest ENDF/B-VI (pointwise) evaluations of the capture and the total cross sections shows agreement within 1 to 3%.},

    abstractNote = {A Working Party on International Evaluation Co-operation was established under the sponsorship of the OECD/NEA Nuclear Science Committee (NSC) to promote the exchange of information on nuclear data evaluations, validation, and related topics. Its aim is also to provide a framework for co-operative activities between members of the major nuclear data evaluation projects. This includes the possible exchange of scientists in order to encourage co-operation. Requirements for experimental data resulting from this activity are compiled. The Working Party determines common criteria for evaluated nuclear data files with a view to assessing and improving the quality and completeness of evaluated data. The Parties to the project are: ENDF (United States), JEFF/EFF (NEA Data Bank Member countries), and JENDL (Japan). Co-operation with evaluation projects of non-OECD countries are organised through the Nuclear Data Section of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). NEA/NSC Subgroup 15 has had the task to assess self-shielding effects in the unresolved resonance range of structural materials, in particular their importance at various energies, and possible ways to deal with them in shielding and activation work. The principal results achieved are summarised briefly, in particular: - New data base consisting of high-resolution transmission data measured at Oak Ridge and Geel; - Improved theoretical understanding of cross-section fluctuations, including their prediction, that has been derived from the Hauser-Feshbach theory; - Benchmark results on the importance of self-shielding in iron at various energies; - Consequences for information storage in evaluated nuclear data files; - Practical utilisation of self-shielding information from evaluated files. Benchmark results as well as the Hauser-Feshbach theory show that self-shielding effects are important up to a 4-or 5-MeV neutron energy. Fluctuation factors extracted from high-resolution total cross-section data can be used to approximate also unmeasured fluctuations of partial cross-sections and their effects. More rigorous methods can be based on Monte Carlo sampling of resonance ladders provided that average resonance parameters are available. Needs for further work on techniques and codes have been identified but the Subgroup's main tasks appear to be fulfilled.},
