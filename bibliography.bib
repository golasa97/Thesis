Since that time, SAMMY has evolved to the point where it is now in use around the world for analysis of many different types of data. SAMMY is not limited to incident neutrons but can also be used for incident protons, alpha particles, or other charged particles; likewise, Coulomb exit hannels can be included. Corrections for a wide variety of experimental conditions are available in the code: Doppler and resolution broadening, multiple-scattering corrections for capture or reaction yields, normalizations and backgrounds, to name but a few. The fitting procedure is Bayes' method, and data and parameter covariance matrices are properly treated within the code. Pre- and post-processing capabilities are also available, including (but not limited to) connections with the Evaluated Nuclear Data Files. Though originally designed for use in the resolved resonance region, SAMMY also includes a treatment for data analysis in the unresolved resonance region.},

Formalized inclusion of information from resolved resonances via Bayes' theorem has helped to remove discrepancies between resolved and unresolved parameters and has improved resonance statistics. Comparison with the latest ENDF/B-VI (pointwise) evaluations of the capture and the total cross sections shows agreement within 1 to 3%.},

    abstractNote = {A Working Party on International Evaluation Co-operation was established under the sponsorship of the OECD/NEA Nuclear Science Committee (NSC) to promote the exchange of information on nuclear data evaluations, validation, and related topics. Its aim is also to provide a framework for co-operative activities between members of the major nuclear data evaluation projects. This includes the possible exchange of scientists in order to encourage co-operation. Requirements for experimental data resulting from this activity are compiled. The Working Party determines common criteria for evaluated nuclear data files with a view to assessing and improving the quality and completeness of evaluated data. The Parties to the project are: ENDF (United States), JEFF/EFF (NEA Data Bank Member countries), and JENDL (Japan). Co-operation with evaluation projects of non-OECD countries are organised through the Nuclear Data Section of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). NEA/NSC Subgroup 15 has had the task to assess self-shielding effects in the unresolved resonance range of structural materials, in particular their importance at various energies, and possible ways to deal with them in shielding and activation work. The principal results achieved are summarised briefly, in particular: - New data base consisting of high-resolution transmission data measured at Oak Ridge and Geel; - Improved theoretical understanding of cross-section fluctuations, including their prediction, that has been derived from the Hauser-Feshbach theory; - Benchmark results on the importance of self-shielding in iron at various energies; - Consequences for information storage in evaluated nuclear data files; - Practical utilisation of self-shielding information from evaluated files. Benchmark results as well as the Hauser-Feshbach theory show that self-shielding effects are important up to a 4-or 5-MeV neutron energy. Fluctuation factors extracted from high-resolution total cross-section data can be used to approximate also unmeasured fluctuations of partial cross-sections and their effects. More rigorous methods can be based on Monte Carlo sampling of resonance ladders provided that average resonance parameters are available. Needs for further work on techniques and codes have been identified but the Subgroup's main tasks appear to be fulfilled.},

Effects of the unresolved resonance structure on self-shielding and multiple scattering were treated by Monte Carlo techniques based on resonance statistics and average resonance parameters. It was found that the average cross sections and average resonance parameters given in the new evaluation permit very satisfactory reproduction of all the test data. Indications are that the average total and capture cross sections including self-shielding are now known below 200 keV with accuracies close to those requested in nuclear technology. }

    abstract = { A new module, Probability tables for the Unresolved Region using Monte Carlo (PURM), has been developed for the AMPX-2000 cross-section–processing system. PURM uses a Monte Carlo approach to calculate probability tables on an evaluator-defined energy grid in the unresolved-resonance region. For each probability table, PURM samples a Wigner spacing distribution for pairs of resonances surrounding the reference energy (i.e., energy specified in the cross-section evaluation). The resonance distribution is sampled for each spin sequence (i.e., l-J pair), and PURM uses the Δ3-statistics test to determine the number of resonances to sample for each spin sequence. For each resonance, PURM samples the resonance widths from a chi-square distribution for a specified number of degrees of freedom. Once the resonance parameters are sampled, PURM calculates the total, capture, fission, and scatter cross sections at the reference energy using the single-level Breit-Wigner formalism with appropriate treatment for temperature effects. Probability tables have been calculated and compared with NJOY. The probability tables and cross-section values that are calculated by PURM and NJOY are in agreement, and the verification studies with NJOY establish the computational capability for generating probability tables using the new AMPX module PURM. }

    abstract = { The ENDF/B-IV prescription fails to represent correctly the 238U total (and scattering) cross section between the levels of the resolved range. We show how this representation can be improved by properly accounting for the contribution of levels outside the resolved region to the cross section at energies inside the resolved region, and by substituting the more precise multi-level Breit-Wigner formula for the presently used single-level formula. We illustrate the importance of computing accurately the minima in the total cross section by comparing values of the self-shielded capture resonance integral computed with ENDF/B-IV and with a more accurate cross-section model. }

    abstract = {An evaluation for neutron induced reactions of 232Th has been performed in the unresolved resonance region from 4 to 100keV. A generalized single-level representation compatible with the energy-dependent options of the ENDF-6 format has been used. The average partial cross sections have been expressed in terms of transmission coefficients by applying the Hauser–Feschbach statistical reaction theory including width-fluctuations. The evaluation is based on a combined analysis of experimental average cross section data (including the most recent capture cross section data obtained at the time-of-flight facilities GELINA and n_TOF), and results of dispersive coupled-channel optical model calculations. Experimental data on transmission and self-indication measurements as well as integral benchmark calculations have been used for validation. The evaluation also includes covariance information.}
